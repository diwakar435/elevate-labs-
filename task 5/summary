Summary of Heart Disease Dataset EDA
Overview
This Jupyter notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset containing 303 rows and 14 columns. The dataset includes various medical features related to heart disease diagnosis.

Key Steps in the Analysis
Data Loading & Initial Inspection

Imported necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)

Loaded the dataset from a CSV file

Examined basic dataset characteristics:

Shape: 303 rows Ã— 14 columns

First few rows using head()

Statistical properties using describe()

Data Exploration

Checked data types of columns (all numeric)

Examined unique values in the target variable (0 = no disease, 1 = disease)

Counted frequency distribution of target variable (165 cases with disease, 138 without)

Visualizations

Created count plots showing distribution of target variable

Analyzed target distribution by gender (sex)

Used catplot to show target distribution split by gender

Key Findings

The dataset is balanced with slightly more cases of heart disease (165) than non-cases (138)

Gender analysis shows different patterns in disease prevalence between males and females

All features are numeric, with a mix of continuous and categorical variables

Next Steps
The notebook appears to be the beginning of a more comprehensive EDA, with potential for further analysis including:

Correlation analysis between features

More detailed visualizations of feature distributions

Potential feature engineering

Preparation for machine learning modeling

The analysis provides a solid foundation for understanding the heart disease dataset before building predictive models.
